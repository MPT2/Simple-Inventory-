  <h3 align="left"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
    <p>An inventory system combines desktop software, barcode scanners, barcode labels, and mobile devices to streamline the tracking of inventory (e.g. consumables, goods, SKUs, supplies, etc.) as product flows through a warehouse environment. This could be a single stockroom or multiple warehouses spread across the country.</p>

      <h3 align="left"><b>How Inventory Control Works</b></h3>
    <p>At its core, inventory control works by tracking two main functions of your stockroom or warehouse — receiving (incoming) and shipping (outgoing). There's other actions that take place such as movement, or relocating, of inventory, as well as in manufacturing situations raw materials are decremented and finished goods get incremented. The act of perfoming physical inventory counts is another input to an inventory system that allows it to accurately keep track of inventory levels..</p>

  <h3 align="left"><b>Benefits of an inventory system</b></h3>
    <p>The goal of inventory control is to accurately know current inventory levels and minimize understock and overstock situations. Whether you are tracking inventory used to perform a service or sold to customers, a barcode inventory solution provides staff accountability and minimizes inventory stockouts and shrinkage. By efficiently tracking quantities across stocking locations you’ll have insight and be able to make smarter inventory decisions. An inventory system provides the necessary knowledge both for the warehouse worker to perform daily tasks and management to have product and financial insight.</p>
