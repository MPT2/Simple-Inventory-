# Simple-Employee-Inventory
This is a very basic system that I have coded in PHP the first time I learn CRUD operations. The system allows to enter employee details 
of any company or organizations lets say, After that each employee will needs to assign the devices or assests used by them. The system 
consist simple UI to manipulate the overall functionality. It's not for commercial use. The PHP beginner's can use for their understanding 
basic PHP CRUD Operations, through functions.
